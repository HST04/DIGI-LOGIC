# Component Library

Supported component types (metadata and intended semantics):
- AND: 2-input AND gate
- OR: 2-input OR gate
- NOT: single-input inverter
- DFF: edge-triggered D flip-flop (Q, Qn)
- MUX: 2:1 multiplexer
- DECODER: 2-to-4 decoder
- COUNTER: simple binary counter
- BUS: logical grouping for multi-bit nets

Each component should include a small "meta" section containing propagation delay and human-readable description.
